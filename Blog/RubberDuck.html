                  <p>I recently started learning some new programming languages. I'm really excited about it, but sometimes I just <em>can not</em> think of the solution or what is wrong with my code.I found myself continuously bugging my partner about my problems and as I'd explain things to him I'd suddenly figure it out. He often didn't even have to say a word! Rubber Duck Programming - It turns out it's a thing (wiki it).</p>
                  <p>The name is a reference to a story in the book <em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em>. I programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug his code by forcing himself to explain it, line-by-line to the duck. Many programmers have often explained their programming problems to someone else and then worked out the solution in the process. You can actually use an inanimate object instead (you may just drive the people in your life insane otherwise).</p>
                  <p>What is your rubber duck? How do you manage to debug your code? Talking to someone has proven to be really useful for me.</p>
                  <p>My partner goes back to work on Monday and has left me with a little note and a rubber duck. It was really sweet of himm and I'm sure the duck will get a lot of talk time. If that fails I have a new "stress ball" and a cellphone!</p>
