          <h3>Intro to Git and GitHub</h3>
          <p class="blog-post-meta">28 December, 2014 by Sandra Muller in Blog Posts</p>
        </br>
        <p>
            SO a few days ago I knew nothing about Git and GitHub as well as the idea of posting soure code to the cloud! This blog post is about that. For all the aspiring developers! (*You guys rock*)
        </p>
        <h3>Version Control:</h3>
        <p>
            Git is version control. It's a command prompt app that allows you to browse repositories and files. I use Gitshell, which is Powershell with easy access to Git operations. So you can add/remove/rename files. Basically anything you can do in your desktop folder you can do on Powershell. Git or Version control keeps track of your files and remembers all of the changes you’ve made and when you make them. It allows you to roll back to an earlier version of a file via the use of commits (see commits).
        </p>
        <p>
        Click<a href="http://SandraMuller.github.io/Blog/CommandLine.html">  here</a>  if you would like to see my command line basic cheatsheet.   
    </p>
    <h3>Git and GitHub</h3>
    <p>
        GitHub is a web app that runs over Git version control. Git is the history of all your files including changes and Github allows you to browse and manage the history and the files easily as an interface for Git. This is important for developers as it allows us to work on the same projects with a combined history and edit, change or develop the projects in such a way that they can be easily merged together.
    </p>
    <h3>Commits</h3>
    <p>
       So when you are using git any changes to your repository, a.k.a repo/files/folders, are stored in a commit that can be called upon. Commits are a safety net. It’s like saving your changes. You can go back through them and restore something if you need to.
    </p>
    <h3>Calling all go Git'ters - Tracking Changes</h3>
    <p>
        There are three stages of a Git change:
        <ol>
          <li>Untracked (git status)</li>
          <li>Staged (git add file)</li>
          <li>Commit (Saving files)</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
        If you type in git status (in the prompt for the folder directory you are tracking with GitHub) you will get a prompt notifying you of how many changes you have made and to what files. It will also prompt you to add the file, which will take you through to staged. Once the changes are staged you can commit them. After that you push them to GitHub "the cloud". Your changes will be uploaded to the repo on GitHub. If you made a mistake and you can't easily fix it then you can go back to an earlier commit.
    </p>
    <p>
        For this blog I have simplified my explanation of this process.
    </p>
    <h3>Git Command</h3>
    <p>
        Here is a copy of my command prompts (or my cheatsheet I suppose):
      <ul>
        <li>git pull origin master - If I want to get changes to my remote repository from origin</li><br/>
        <li>git fetch origin master - gets the changes, but does not merge them with local branch</li><br/>
        <li>git push origin master - will push your locally commit changes to GitHub</li><br/>
        <li>git status - tells you if you have made any changes and if any files are untracked</li><br/>
        <li>git add filename - this stages the file for commit (you can stage multiple files and commit once)</li><br/>
        <li>git commit -m "commit message" - will commit all staged files</li><br/>
        <li>git log - shows all commits or you can git log -5 and this will show you the last 5 commits</li><br/>
        <li>subl filename - you have to be in the correct folder that the file is in</li><br/>
        <li>git reset Head~number - reverses a file from the added section(staged) to bring it back to untracked</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        So that was the crash course! It's all really interesting and fun to learn. It's also empowering as you get to learn how to use the command line and it gives you a greater understanding of your repository and how to navigate your PC with ease. It's great getting a glimpse of how you will work as a developer with regards to working on the same projects.
