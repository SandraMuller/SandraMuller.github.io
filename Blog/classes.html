          <h3>Classes and a bit about Object Orientated Programming</h3>

            <h3>OOP or Object Orientated Programming</h3>
            <p>OOP is a programming style based on the concept of "objects". Objects are data structures that contain data often know as attributes and code in the form of procedures also know as methods. So imagine you had many containers and you wanted to access elements in those containers. You could open them up and do what you need to with the contents and then move on. That's  a very simple explanation and outline, but it gives you a basic understanding. Programming moved towards this method of "putting things into containers" so that the code was easily accessable and grouped nicely - ultimately organized better. Before OOP, code was extremely long and you would have to go through lines of it. Now if you know what object you are looking for you can find all the code belonging to that object easily. The most popular method for creating objects is by using classes, meaning that objects are instances of classes.</p>
            <h3>Classes</h3>
            <p>Based on what was said above, a class is a group of related methods and variables. Methods are functions that take an input and return a result. Variables are properties of the class. E.g. calculateAge is a method that would take in a variable  called date of birth and return the persons age. Below is an example of a class called Car.</p><br>
