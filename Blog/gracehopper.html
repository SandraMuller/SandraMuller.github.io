            <h3>Grace Hopper Quotes</h3>
            <p><em>"It is better to beg forgiveness, than ask permission."</em></p>
            <p><em>"Humans are allergic to change. They love to say, 'We've always done it this way.' I try to fight that."</em></p>
            <p><em>"I had a running compiler and nobody would touch it. â€¦ they carefully told me, computers could only do arithmetic; they could not do programs."</em></p><br>
            <h3>Her life's effect:</h3>
            <p>Grace Hopper was an amazing woman who, in her lifetime as a leader in the field of software development, contributed to the transition from primitive programming techniques to the use of sophisticated compilers.</p>
            <p> Her life inspired the <em>Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing</em>. It is a series of conferences designed to bring the research and career interests of women in computing to the forefront. Several awards are presented at the Grace Hopper Celebration to recognize technical women and those who support them. It is also the world's largest gathering of women in computing. Its amazing to hear that they provide free childcare to all attendees, as well as an on-site Nursing Mothers Room.</p>
            <p>The amount of freedom and opportunities provided to woman in our day and age are phenomenal. Grace Hopper's wit and ability to hold her own is an inspiration to us all. To make an impact in a field such as software development is a dream for most, but for her it was her reality, her life. What if we all had that mentality? How could we shape the field of software development?</p>
            <p>Grace Hopper said, "We're flooding people with information. We need to feed it through a processor. A human must turn information into intelligence or knowledge. We've tended to forget that no computer will ever ask a new question."</p>
            <p>So what questions will you ask?</p><br><br>
