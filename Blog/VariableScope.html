              <h3>What is a Variable Scope?</h3>
              <p>The scope of a variable determines its lifetime and controls its visibility and availability to each of the methods within a program. A variable's scope is always the full extent of the code block it is declared in.</p>
              <p>You can create nested variables scopes, for example, a loop within a method within a class provides three levels of nested code blocks and thus equates to three levels of nested scope. if you declare a variable in one if these nested scopes, it will only be visible to the current scope and any scopes nested within it.</p>
              <p>You can also scope variables at class-level or method-level. Class-level scope variables are available to any non-static methods within the class. Method-level scope variables are available to all parts of the method code block including nested scopes. Here is an example of a variable declared within a method and then used in an if statement, and then a variable declared within an if statement. The method-level variable is accessable outside of the if statement, whereas the if statement variable is not accessable outside of the if statement.</p>

              <br><h3>Access Modifiers</h3>
              <p>An access modifier is used to change the scope of a variable or a method. You can set it as public, private, protected and internal.</p>
              <p><strong>PRIVATE</strong> means that the variable or method is only accessable inside the class it is declared in.</p>
              <p><strong>PUBLIC</strong> means that the variable or method can be accessed by code outside of the class as well.</p>
              <p><strong>PROTECTED</strong> means that the variable or method is only accessable inside the class it is declared in and in classes derived from that class.</p>
              <p><strong>INTERNAL</strong> means that the variable or method is only accessably in the same project its declared in.</p><br>
              <p>So we have discussed a nested variable scope and say we have a variable declared as a public variable inside a class, it will be accessable from outside of that class. Whereas, if we had declared it as private in a class it would no longer be accessable outside of that class. Please see example below.</p>
