          <h3><em>Stepping out & committing fully to something new</em></h3>

            <h3>Chef's vs Restaurant Consumers</h3>
            <p>
            Equating learning and programming to being a chef rather than just a consumer is genius (kitchen vs restaurant) - thank you Shereef from EDA for the analogy. With a consumer mind set we would look through a menu and decide what we feel like having today. If we don't like the meal we would complain about it, return it and generally not bother ourselves like we would have, had we been the chef's. I love cooking. I happen to have gotten pretty decent over the last few years. It took practice and dedication. I try new things, I'm committed to the process and most of all I love the end result. As developers we are our own chef's. We have our tools and we learn our craft and then we create. By fully embracing all of the languages, technologies and skills we are learning; we can do great things. Things we never thought we were capable of.

            <h3>Enspiral Dev Academy Experience</h3>
            <p>
            I joined EDA 4 weeks into the program. As it is they go fast. There's generally a lot to download every week and now I'm playing catch-up as well. All that said and through all the hours I've thrown into this already, I'm loving it so far. It's really exciting going at this pace and being exposed to so much. Even better than that is having my fear of "will I be ready for the work place?" put to ease. You have access to experienced developers and they don't mind all your questions even when they are at odd hours.  
            </p>
            I love the culture and the feel. The open-ness and the engagement. You are who you are. The thing with development is that everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. You as an individual are cultivated. You can pick your streamline.
            <p>
            I am extremely excited for a career in software development as I have seen how the IT companies invest in their employees. I' have also seen how they add to their employees development as individuals and at the work place. EDA has carried this through into their teaching environment. You work hard, but you have a lot of fun along the way.

            You are who you want to be.
